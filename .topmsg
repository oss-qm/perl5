Subject: Fix h2ph with double-quote-delimited #include directives.

Allow the quote mark delimiter also for those #include directives chased with "h2ph -a".

Debian bug #479762.

Also add the directory prefix of the current file when the quote syntax is
used; 'require' will only look in @INC, not the current directory.

Upstream change 33835.

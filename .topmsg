Subject: Various debian-specific ExtUtils changes

 * Respect umask during installation, and set as appropriate for each of
   perl, vendor and site (policy requires group writable site dirs).

 * Don't install .packlist or perllocal.pod for perl or vendor.
 * Fiddle with *PREFIX and variables written to the makefile so that
   install directories may be changed when make is run by passing
   PREFIX= to the "make install" command (used when packaging
   modules).

 * Set location of libperl.a to /usr/lib.
 * Note that libperl-dev package is required for embedded linking.
 * Change install target dependencies to facilitate parallel makes.

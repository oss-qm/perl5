Subject: Tweak enc2xs to follow symlinks and ignore missing @INC directories.
Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/290336

- ignore missing directories,
- follow symlinks (/usr/share/perl/5.8 -> 5.8.4).
- filter "." out when running "enc2xs -C", it's unnecessary and causes
  issues with follow => 1 (see #603686 and [rt.cpan.org #64585])

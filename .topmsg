Subject: Fix Sys::Syslog slowness when logging with non-native mechanisms. (Closes: #498776)

Revert the 0.25 second timeout change that was added in 0.19 to address
an OSX problem with UDP sockets and ICMP responses.

Fixed upstream in Sys::Syslog 0.25, which changes the timeout default
to 0 again on non-OSX hosts and makes it configurable with setlogsock().

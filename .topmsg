Subject: Fix a memory leak with Scalar::Util::weaken(). (Closes: #506324)

Upstream change 34209:

DBI memory leak in 5.10.0 due to change 26530

A weakref to a HV would leak, because the xhv_backreferences
array is created with a refcount of 2 (to avoid premature freeing
during global destruction), but the RC was only decremented once
when the parent HV was freed.
Also, when thread cloned, the new array was being created with a
RC of 1, rather than 2, which coincidentally worked due to the
first bug.

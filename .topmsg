Subject: Fix a failure in CGI/t/fast.t when FCGI is installed
Origin: upstream

Cherry picked from CGI-3.48.

The test is skipped in clean build environments because FCGI is not in
the core.

Upstream has dropped the whole test from the Perl core distribution for
the 5.12 series because it relies on external modules. Possibly we should
do that instead.

Subject: [PATCH] Make h2ph look in "include-fixed", needed by at least gcc 4.3
Closes: #522673

As seen in <http://bugs.debian.org/522673>, since 4.2.0 or so
gcc's search path has a new "include-fixed" directory,
which currently contains <syslimits.h> and a few other headers.

Converting <syslimits.h> therefore fails unless h2ph knows about the new
directory too.

See http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2007-02/msg02038.html for some
background to the gcc change.

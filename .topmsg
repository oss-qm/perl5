Subject: Tweak @INC so that the ordering is:

    etc (for config files)
    site (5.8.1)
    vendor (all)
    core (5.8.1)
    site (version-indep)
    site (pre-5.8.1)

The rationale being that an admin (via site), or module packager
(vendor) can chose to shadow core modules when there is a newer
version than is included in core.

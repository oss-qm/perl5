Subject: Configure CPANPLUS to use the site directories by default.
Closes: 533707
    
The core modules usually default to INSTALLDIRS=perl (ExtUtils::MakeMaker)
or installdirs=core (Module::Build), so we need to explicitly ask for
the site destination to get upgraded versions into /usr/local.

See also the sister patch, debian/cpan_definstalldirs .

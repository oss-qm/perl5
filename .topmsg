Subject: Make Archive::Extract work with recent versions of GNU tar
Closes: 526822

Upstream fix from Archive-Extract-0.31_03:

Changes for 0.31_03 Wed Mar 11 12:38:43 2009
============================================
* Newer versions of 'tar' (1.21 and up) now print record size
  to STDERR as well if v OR t is given (used to be both). This
  is a 'feature' according to the changelog, so we must now only
  inspect STDOUT, otherwise, failures like these occur:

  Thanks to tcallawa from RedHat for tracking this down.

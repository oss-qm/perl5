Subject: Make DynaLoader work without Config_heavy.pl again
Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/549170
Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/575308

Expand a few Config variables at build time if needed to accommodate the
Debian perl-base <> perl split: dl_dlext and dl_dlso come from
Config_heavy.pl which isn't in perl-base.

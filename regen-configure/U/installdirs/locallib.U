?S:uselocallib:
?S:	This variable tells whether the USELOCALLIB is defined.
?S:.
?S:locallib:
?S:	This variable contains the eventual value of the LOCALLIB symbol,
?S:	which is the name of the private library for this package.  It may
?S:	have a ~ on the front. It is up to the makefile to eventually create
?S:	this directory while performing installation (with ~ substitution).
?S:	This differs from $sitelib in that $sitelib is often
?S:	a shared network directory while $locallib is
?S:	at a local disk, because of policy/administrative issues
?S:	like for example caching (performance), licensing, or security.
?S:.
?S:locallibexp:
?S:	This variable is the ~name expanded version of locallib, so that you
?S:	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.
?S:.
?S:installlocallib:
?S:	This variable is really the same as locallibexp but may differ on
?S:	those systems using AFS. For extra portability, only this variable
?S:	should be used in makefiles.

?S:installlocallibexp:
?S:	This variable is the ~name expanded version of installlocallib,
?S:	so that you may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.

?C:USELOCALLIB:
?C:	This symbol, if defined, tells that the directories
?C:	LOCALLIB, LOCALLIB_EXP, LOCALARCH, and LOCALARCH_EXP,

?C:LOCALLIB:
?C:	This symbol contains the name of the private library for this package.
?C:	The library is private in the sense that it needn't be in anyone's
?C:	execution path, but it should be accessible by the world.  The program
?C:	should be prepared to do ~ expansion.
?C:	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
?C:	Local administration may place extensions and modules in
?C:	this directory.
?C:	This differs from SITELIB in that SITELIB is often

?C:LOCALLIB_EXP:
?C:	This symbol contains the ~name expanded version of LOCALLIB, to be used

For various local software administration reasons and
especially if $sitelib
happens to be a shared network resource, you may want to have
a directory for extensions and modules that resides on a possibly local disk.
If this scenario doesn't sound applicable, accept the default 'none'.

if $test "X$ans" = X; then
	uselocallib="$undef"
	locallib=""
	locallibexp=""

		installlocallib=''
	fi
	locallib="$ans"
	locallibexp="$ansexp"
	if $afs; then
		$cat <<EOM

Since you are running AFS, I need to distinguish the directory in
which locally installed files reside from the directory in which they
are installed (and from which they are presumably copied to the former
directory by occult means).

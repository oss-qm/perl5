?S:sitehtml1:
?S:	This variable contains the name of the directory in which site-specific
?S:	html source pages are to be put.  It is the responsibility of the
?S:	Makefile.SH to get the value of this into the proper command.
?S:	You must be prepared to do the ~name expansion yourself.
?S:	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
?S:	After perl has been installed, users may install their own local
?S:	html pages in this directory with
?S:		MakeMaker Makefile.PL
?S:	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.

?S:sitehtml1exp:
?S:	This variable is the same as the sitehtml1 variable, but is filename
?S:	expanded at configuration time, for convenient use in makefiles.

?S:installsitehtml1:
?S:	This variable is really the same as sitehtml1exp, unless you are using
?S:	AFS in which case it points to the read/write location whereas
?S:	html1direxp only points to the read-only access location. For extra
?S:	portability, you should only use this variable within your makefiles.

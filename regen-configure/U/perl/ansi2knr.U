$me:  FATAL ERROR:
This version of $package can only be compiled by a compiler that
understands function prototypes.  Unfortunately, your C compiler
	$cc $ccflags
doesn't seem to understand them.  Sorry about that.

If GNU cc is available for your system, perhaps you could try that instead.

Eventually, we hope to support building Perl with pre-ANSI compilers.
If you would like to help in that effort, please contact <perlbug@perl.org>.

Aborting Configure now.
